			<p>I am a programmer, game designer, and recent graduate from RPI. My resume is <u><a href="fahyc.github.io/Resume.pdf">here</a></u>. This is a portfolio of the games and other projects that Iâ€™ve had a major part in. My personal favorite is Xenonet, which is a networked game, but The Aquatic Messenger, which is a VR project, is probably the most professional and impressive.</p>

							This is an in progress project for the HTC Vive. In the vein of World of Plankton (see below), this game allows the player shrink down and explore the microscopic life of the lake as if they were part of it in Virtual Reality, catching and examining plankton such as the Daphnia Pulicaria. There are several technical achievements in this piece such as complete freedom of movement and continuous scale changing down to tenths of a millimeter without floating point errors in transforms, good interface design, and convincing behavior by our virtual organisms. I was lead programmer and project manager.

							This is a strategy game based on the idea of the internet being a way to control the populations of the world. Players act as shadowy organizations that use subtle censorship and plants in the network to fight for control of a simple simulation of the internet. It is a multiplayer RTS with connection over the internet if you do port forwarding, or LAN play otherwise. It has a multiplayer lobby powered by AWS Lambda so the players don't have to enter IP addresses every time they want to play.

								WoP is a museum exhibit showcasing the aquatic life of Lake George. The player can change scales to swim with plankton of different sizes. This game is only a part of the larger project which includes sculptures and displays, which is itself a part of the Jefferson project which is a predominantly research project focused on Lake George. A lot of people worked on this, and the credits, as well as a download, can be found <a href="http://www.arts.rpi.edu/~ruiz/WorldOfPlankton/WOP.htm">here</a>.

							This is a demonstration of a very barebones webGL framework I made in around a month for Computer Graphics. It has a component based system, raycasting and custom meshes and shaders - though I obviously didn't go through too much effort to make those custom shaders or shapes. I worked with Will Pheloung and he did most of the game while I did most of the engine. <BR><u><a href = http://homepages.rpi.edu/~fahyc/Graphics/Final/>Click here to play.</a></u>

						<div class="panel-body"> 
							This is a demonstration of a secure authentication system. When the account is created, it stores the password in hashed and salted format in an AWS Dynamodb database. When logging in, it compares the password, then sends back a token. This token can be used in place of a password for one operation, and at the end of the operation a new one is sent. The backend could work with other things such as mobile apps and is designed so it is easy to add new password protected functions.

							<BR> The Amazon SES account I own is in sandbox mode so it will not send emails to anyone not confirmed with me. I allow unconfirmed accounts to function as full accounts however so everything should work fine.
