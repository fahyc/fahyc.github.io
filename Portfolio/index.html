			<p>I am a programmer and game designer. Currently self-employed, working on a Unity topdown space game and framework. My resume is <u><a href="https://fahyc.github.io/Resume.pdf">here</a></u>. This is a portfolio of many of the games and other projects that Iâ€™ve had a major part in. I also had a standard software role at Google - check resume for more info.

							Signal Person Training is a VR training simulation for the rift that teaches construction workers the standard gestures for signalling cranes and how to be safe while doing it. While I joined the team just out of college, I worked on some core code and architecure and eventually proved to be the programming powerhouse of SPT as the lead developer's focus was drawn into another project. My highlights here include building dynamic crane failure sequences from static models, redoing problem gesture recognition routines that still failed after weeks of tuning, core state machine code for directing lesson scenes in a maintainable and flexible way, building 13 5-10 minute scenarios including coding the scenario specific behaviors for each of those scenarios, prototype voice recognition, nearly all the sound effects, and state machine based AI for NPCs.

							This is the trailer for the game which is composed almost entirely of gameplay footage - hopefully it will give you a good idea of what the product is like as I obviously can't give you a copy of this software. <BR>

							This was a weekend long project meant to test out the Unity high definition rendering pipeline and to try to get something close to photorealistic on the portfolio. Note that the models aren't mine. There's more info in the video description <u><a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz4u0D2DZoc>here</a></u>, but the goal of the project was to show my ability to use the tools and make the art shine. I'm a gameplay programmer, not an artist.
							Below is the video of the result. You can also download the build <u><a href = https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BVsj_ohfMKitzi4wFgW8j6rCaS82mvn0>here</a></u>. (Size: 153 MB)

							This is a VR museum exhibit for the Vive. In the vein of World of Plankton (see below), this game allows the player shrink down and explore the microscopic life of the lake as if they were part of it in Virtual Reality, catching and examining plankton such as the Daphnia Pulicaria. I was responsible for several technical achievements in this piece such as complete freedom of movement and continuous scale changing down to player height of tenths of a millimeter without floating point errors in transforms or motion sickness, immersive effects and timescaling to go with scale changing, and convincing behavior by our virtual organisms. I was lead programmer and project manager.
							<BR> You can download an early beta <u><a href = https://fahyc.itch.io/the-aquatic-messenger>here</a></u>. This version didn't have an amazing tutorial - the website explains how to use the teleportation and scaling tools.

							This is a strategy game based on the idea of the internet being a way to control the populations of the world. Players act as shadowy organizations that use subtle censorship and plants in the network to fight for control of a simple simulation of the internet. It is a multiplayer RTS with connection over the internet if you do port forwarding, or LAN play otherwise. It has a multiplayer lobby powered by AWS Lambda so the players don't have to enter IP addresses every time they want to play.

								WoP is a museum exhibit showcasing the aquatic life of Lake George. The player can change scales to swim with plankton of different sizes. This game is only a part of the larger project which includes sculptures and displays, which is itself a part of the Jefferson project which is a predominantly research project focused on Lake George. A lot of people worked on this, and the credits, as well as a download, can be found <a href="http://www.arts.rpi.edu/~ruiz/WorldOfPlankton/WOP.htm">here</a>.
